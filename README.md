# kindle-literary-clock
Use a kindle ebook-reader as literary clock:

- for every minute of the day a citation from a piece of literature is shown containing the current time (printed in **bold letters**)
- use Shift-C to toggle between clock-mode and ordinary mode of the device
- use special keys to reveal the origin of the current citation ("quiz-mode")
