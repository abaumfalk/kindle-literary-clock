    The window overlooked the Rue Dauphine, a long, dark street. All Paris seemed
    to pass below, and the noise was so great that the window shook.

    his gaze piercing me from the lobby. A curtain of stars, miles of them, are scattered,
    glowing, across the sky and their multitude humbles me, which I have a hard time
    tolerating. She shrugs and nods after I say something about forms of anxiety.
    It's as if her mind is having a hard time communicating with her mouth, as if
    she is searching for a rational analysis of who I am, which is, of course, an
    impossibility: there ... is ... no ... key.
